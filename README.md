# mail-merge-project-udemy
The program reads the list of names from a text file, then reads a template letter from another text file, replaces a placeholder in the letter with each name, and saves the personalized letter to a new file for each person. I learned about the basics of file I/O, string manipulation, and loops in Python.
This project was created as a part of a Udemy course on Python programming. The code for this project was adapted from the course material, and some modifications were made to suit the specific requirements of the project.

Mail Merge Project
This project is a simple mail merge application that takes a list of names from a file, creates personalized letters for each name using a starting letter template, and saves them in a separate folder ready to be sent.

Usage
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
Run the main.py file to execute the program.
The program will read the list of names from the invited_names.txt file in the ./Input/Names/ directory and create a personalized letter for each name using the starting_letter.txt file in the ./Input/Letters/ directory. The letters will be saved in the ./Output/ReadyToSend/ directory with the file name letter_for_[name].txt.

Dependencies
The project uses only built-in Python modules, so there are no external dependencies.

Credits
This project was created as a part of a Udemy course, and the starting code was provided by the course instructor.
